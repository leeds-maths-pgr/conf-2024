Tired of people thinking pure maths is useless? Sick of people saying applied maths is nothing more than physics? Had enough of people assuming statisticians are just data analysts? 

**Put them in their place with a brilliant talk/poster for your research area!**

We highly encourage you to contribute a talk and/or a poster, no matter which group or stage-of-study you are in. 
Talks will be very short (~20 minutes), and you will have the opportunity to summarise your research area to people who would never otherwise give it a moment's thought. 

**Please sign up to contribute a talk and/or a poster by filling out [this poll](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2FPages%2FResponsePage.aspx%3Fid%3DqO3qvR3IzkWGPlIypTW3y8cH16BbCNtBh3zdLxzekOdUNFI2QzQ4VzIyTDFWTzQ1WkZFUkw3M1pWNS4u%26loop%3D1&data=05%7C02%7Cmmyl%40leeds.ac.uk%7C8ccc3581e6fd487076d108dc86d74a47%7Cbdeaeda8c81d45ce863e5232a535b7cb%7C0%7C0%7C638533506426364416%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Rt7IgEnpwPUq6io%2FhlqzeBwzNvcVzzIFl6c28NKRQGg%3D&reserved=0).
