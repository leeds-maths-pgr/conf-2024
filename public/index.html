    <p>The School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds is proud to host its annual conference specially for the postgraduate researchers, bringing together PGRs across all groups and years to:</p>
<ul>
<li>foster understanding of what other people in the School of Maths are doing;</li>
<li>strengthen the community within the School of Maths; and</li>
<li>remind ourselves that there is (much) more to life than research!</li>
</ul>
<p>This year&rsquo;s conference will be held at <strong>Roger Stevens LT15 (11.15)</strong>, from <strong>Wednesday 3 to Friday 5 July 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>Participants can give a talk and/or present a poster: fascinating talks will be scattered over the three days and posters will be appreciated along with cheese and wine. Plus, there will be two prizes awarded to best talks and posters respectively, and the winner can choose their preferred reward from an Amazon voucher, a book voucher, or planting a tree.
We welcome <a href="./call_for_speakers">submissions</a> from all PGRs in the School of Mathematics!</p>
<p>Apart from the PGR talks and posters, we also have an exciting line-up of events and activities planned, including invited talks by Max (<a href="https://mathscity.co.uk/">MathsCity</a>) and Richard (UKRI Future Leaders Fellow), academic and non-academic career sessions, a workshop on maths communication, and a pub quiz.</p>
<p>Lastly we would like to remind you that breakfast and lunch will be provided. Do come and join us if you are around and we look forward to seeing you at the 2024 SoM PGR Conference!</p>
